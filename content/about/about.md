## About

Here lie the writings of MLȘaman, aka Andrei.

![Alt text](yLjLf4oa_400x400.jpg)

Sick and tired of predatory and/or obnoxious platforms like Medium or Substack, but I also don't have the time and energy to put into hosting a proper blog. In the end, why "blog" when you can just commit & push.

Feel encouraged to:
- star this repo
- follow it
